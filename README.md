# E-commerce Database Queries

## Overview  
This repository contains a collection of SQL queries for an e-commerce database system. The queries demonstrate various database operations including data retrieval, updates, schema modifications, and database normalization.

## Features  

### Basic Data Retrieval  
- Simple SELECT queries to view customer, order, and product data  

### Customer Analytics  
- Queries to analyze customer spending and recent activity  

### Product Management  
- Price updates  
- Product discount column addition  

### Database Normalization  
- Implementation of an `order_items` table to normalize the schema  

### Aggregation Queries  
- Calculations of totals, averages, and top products  

## Key Queries  
1. Recent customer orders (last 30 days)  
2. Customer spending totals  
3. Product price updates  
4. Schema modifications (adding discount column)  
5. Database normalization with `order_items` table  
6. Various JOIN operations between tables  

## Database Structure  
The queries work with a typical e-commerce database containing:  
- `customers` table  
- `orders` table  
- `products` table  
- `order_items` table (added through normalization)  

## Usage  
These queries can be used as:  
- Examples for learning SQL  
- Templates for e-commerce applications  
- Demonstrations of database normalization techniques  

## Requirements  
- MySQL or compatible database system  
- Sample e-commerce data loaded into the database
